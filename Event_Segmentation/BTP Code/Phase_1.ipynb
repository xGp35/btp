      "9: The villagers asked him his name and he replied from the book, \"You get what is destined for you\"\n",

      "12: She wrote a note, and gave it to her attendant.\n",

      "34: In the darkness of the night, the watchman's daughter mistook him for her lover and exchanged garlands in front of the picture of God.\n",
      "35: Thus, according to traditions they got married.\n",
      "36: The young man said, \"You get what is destined for you\".\n",
      "37: When she heard this, she realized she had done a mistake, and thought, \"Such mistake is bound to happen, when you rush into doing something without thinking sufficiently about it!\"\n",
      "38: She cursed him and threw him out of the house.\n",
      "39: Saddened for being treated in such manner without being at fault, he was walking slowly, when he saw a marriage procession approaching.\n",
      "40: They had magnificent clothes, and wore precious jewels.\n",
      "41: He followed the groom's procession, which was going to the bride's home, where a lavish ceremony was arranged.\n",
