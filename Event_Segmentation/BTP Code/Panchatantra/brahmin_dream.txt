Once upon a time, there lived a poor brahmin without any friends or relatives. He was a miser and begged alms for a living. One day, he received a pot full of porridge by a generous person. He hanged the earthen pot from the wall and fell asleep staring at it. He drifted into deep sleep and dreamt that there was a famine, and that he exchanged his pot of porridge for a hundred gold coins.

He dreamt that he bought a pair of goats and cows with the money, and made more money by trading milk. He also dreamt that a rich merchant offered his daughterâ€™s hand in marriage and that he had a kid. He was relaxing at home when a group of kids would disturb him. Imagining that he was scaring them away with a stick, he picks up the nearby stick in his sleep and starts waving it around.

The brahmin wakes up suddenly, feeling the porridge on his hands and feet. He realizes that he had destroyed the only food he had for the day and repents his actions.
