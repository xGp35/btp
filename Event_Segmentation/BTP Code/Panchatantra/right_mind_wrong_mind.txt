Two friends, Dharmabuddhi (right, virtuous mind) and Papabuddhi (wrong, wicked mind) lived in a village. Papabuddhi, who was wicked, decided to use the skills of the virtuous Dharmabuddhi to make money. He convinced his friend to together travel the world and earn a lot of money. Once they earned enough money, Papabuddhi convinced his friend that they should bury the money in a forest for safety. He then stole all the money one night and went back to the village.

When the friends went back to the forest to get the money, Papabuddhi feigned ignorance, accused Dharmabuddhi of stealing the money and took the matter to the village elders, who agreed that they should ask the tree spirit in the forest about Dharmabuddhi’s guilt.
Papabuddhi asked his father to hide in the tree bark and speak like the tree spirit to confirm the innocent man’s guilt. Sensing something wrong, Dharmabuddhi set dry leaves and twigs on fire inside the hollow cove of the tree, forcing his friend’s father out.
Papabuddhi’s father confessed to his son’s misdeed and the village elders punished him for it.
